# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview

This project creates an interactive dashboard that visualizes the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called OTUs, or Operational Taxonomic Units) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Using the D3.js and Plotly.js libraries, this dashboard allows users to explore the microbial data for each individual in the study by:
- Selecting a test subject ID from a dropdown menu.
- Viewing demographic information for the selected individual.
- Displaying a bar chart of the top 10 OTUs found in the individual.
- Showing a bubble chart with the distribution of all OTUs found in the sample.

## Live Demo
You can view the deployed app [here](https://manahilr701.github.io/belly-button-challenge).

## Features
- **Dropdown menu**: Allows the user to select a test subject ID to explore.
- **Demographic Info panel**: Displays key details about the individual such as age, gender, ethnicity, and location.
- **Bar Chart**: Shows the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the selected individual.
- **Bubble Chart**: Provides a visual representation of all OTU data, including the OTU ID and sample values.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json).

### Data Fields:
- **names**: List of test subject IDs.
- **metadata**: Demographic information including ethnicity, gender, age, and location for each test subject.
- **samples**: Microbial data for each subject including OTU IDs, sample values, and OTU labels.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For building the structure and layout of the web page.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive design and styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core programming for interactive behavior.
- **D3.js**: To fetch data and manipulate the DOM.
- **Plotly.js**: For creating the bar and bubble charts.
- **Git & GitHub Pages**: Version control and deployment.
